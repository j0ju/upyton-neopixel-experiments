# Why disabled?
#  * invalid-name - micropython uses also CamelCase
#  * import-outside-toplevel - only iport what we need in a function
#  * consider-using-enumerate - not supported on every floating around version of uPython
#                               for in case of older boards
#  * consider-using-in - in case of `in` for a two element set this makes no sense
